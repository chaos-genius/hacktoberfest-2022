## Introduction

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying and detecting the deviation away from the normal functioning of a set of data. This pattern of data behavior is an exception to what is recognized. It is also not in sync with the rest of the data instances. An anomaly is not necessarily a negative sign; it just means something different has occurred.

Discovering these outliers helps to prevent and combat security breaches and risks and measure business activities. It prevents the whole dataset from being vulnerable to attacks and pitfalls.

Anomalies are sometimes used interchangeably with outlier detection.

## Why is Anomaly detection important?

Anomaly detection is important to discover indistinct parts of data that can be compared with other data. This exception could serve as a significant pointer that could impact the business if not addressed.

Anomaly detection also serves as a tool to assess patterns and inaccuracies. It singles out flaws in data to make it accessible for scrutiny and observation down to the source.

This strategy/process allows an organization to make data-driven decisions that may affect its future business. It identifies the organization’s weakest link or threats and helps strengthen them

In this article, we will explore some of the most popular open source software used for anomaly detection.

## Top open source software for Anomaly detection

[Numenta](https://github.com/numenta/NAB) Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) is an open source framework that provides a benchmark for evaluating the performance of real-time anomaly detection methods. The goal of NAB is to provide comparable performance results across a variety of datasets and tasks, so researchers can easily compare their results with those from other systems.

NAB includes data sets from both synthetic and real-world domains and provides configurable benchmarks for comparing anomaly detection methods on these data sets. The benchmarks allow users to specify the desired accuracy level, false positive rate, and false negative rate for their experiments. NAB also enables users to run their own experiments by configuring the parameters of each data set and task.

Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) was created to allow data scientists and machine learning experts to compare results from their anomaly detection algorithms in an apples-to-apples way. NAB is an open source framework for creating benchmark streams of events, which consist of:

- A dataset with real-world, labeled data files.
- A scoring mechanism that rewards early detection and online learning.

[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a Python library for machine learning built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, and gradient boosting.

"Scikit-learn" is an abbreviation for "machine learning in Python". The name was chosen to mimic the "SciPy" library (which provides scientific tools in Python), and it has been said that the logo is based on that of NumPy.

Scikit-learn supports all the common feature extractors such as tree-based estimators (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and linear models (Lasso, Ridge Regression). It also provides unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering or dimensionality reduction techniques. The library includes several support vector classification methods as well.

Scikit-learn's data structures are optimized for speed, but they are also designed to be easy to use so that they can be easily understood by new users.

The library is free software released under the 3-clause BSD license.
